This dataset is the output of the above

This is a dataset of EEG brainwave data that has been processed with our method of statistical extraction

The data was collected from four people (2 male, 2 female) for 60 seconds per state - relaxed, concentrating, neutral. We used a Muse EEG headband which recorded the TP9, AF7, AF8 and TP10 EEG placements via dry electrodes.

Our method of statistical extraction resampled the data since waves must be mathematically described in a temporal fashion.
